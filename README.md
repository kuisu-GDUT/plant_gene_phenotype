## Introduce
This repository contains various scripts and notebooks for analyzing SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data using machine learning techniques, including logistic regression and XGBoost.

### Jupyter Notebooks

snp_otu_tslw_lr.ipynb: Notebook for SNP analysis using logistic regression with TSLW.

snp_otu_tslw_lr_MSW.ipynb: Notebook for SNP analysis using logistic regression with MSW.

snp_otu_xgboost.ipynb: Notebook for SNP analysis using XGBoost.
